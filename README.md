This project is a low-cost, eco-friendly prototype designed to recycle greywater for plant irrigation using Arduino-based automation. It features a multi-stage natural filtration system and automates watering using a soil moisture sensor, relay module, and submersible pump. The system promotes efficient water usage, making it especially useful in regions with limited access to clean water.

## Featured at TechSparX.I 2025 â€“ Technology Showcase

We proudly showcased this project during TechSparX.I 2025, BML Munjal University's annual Joy of Engineering exhibition. The event served as a vibrant platform for students to present innovative, real-world engineering solutions.

Our project, "Greywater Recycling and Smart Irrigation System", offered a sustainable approach to managing wastewater and optimizing irrigation. By combining natural filtration and Arduino-based control, it demonstrated how technology can be applied in simple, impactful ways.

The event witnessed enthusiastic participation from students, faculty, parents, and visitors who engaged with the projects and appreciated their value. Presenting to such an engaged audience was both exciting and rewarding.

We extend our sincere gratitude to our mentor, Dr. Hirdesh Kumar Pharasi, for his continuous support and guidance.

## Working Logic (Flow)

1. Greywater enters the filtration chamber (multi-layered).
2. Filtered water is collected in a reservoir.
3. Soil moisture sensor checks if the soil is dry.
4. Arduino reads sensor data and controls the relay.
5. Pump is activated to irrigate plants only when needed.

## Results

- Filtration improved water clarity and removed odor  
- Moisture sensor-pump interaction functioned reliably  
- System operated for 20+ cycles with consistent output  
- Total cost: â‚¹1600â€“1700
