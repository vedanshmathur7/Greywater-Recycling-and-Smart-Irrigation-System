# Greywater Recycling and Smart Irrigation System

This project is a low-cost, eco-friendly prototype designed to recycle greywater for plant irrigation using Arduino-based automation. It uses a simple multi-stage natural filtration unit and automates watering using a soil moisture sensor and pump control.

> 🎓 Developed as part of the Joy of Engineering (JOE) course at BML Munjal University.

## ⚙️ Working Logic (Flow)

1. Greywater enters the filtration chamber (multi-layered).
2. Filtered water is collected in a reservoir.
3. Soil moisture sensor checks if the soil is dry.
4. Arduino reads sensor data and controls the relay.
5. Pump is activated to irrigate plants only when needed.

## 🧪 Results

- Filtration improved water clarity and removed odor  
- Moisture sensor-pump interaction functioned reliably  
- System operated for 20+ cycles with consistent output  
- Total cost: ₹1600–1700
